[00:00.30] La, la, la-la (yeah)
[00:02.91] Wait 'til I get my money right (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[00:28.41] 
[00:07.03] I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
[00:09.47] When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[00:12.95] I told God I'd be back in a second
[00:15.92] Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
[00:19.12] To whom much is given much is tested
[00:21.58] Get arrested, guess until he get the message (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[00:24.79] I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
[00:27.20] And what I do? Act more stupidly (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[00:31.63] Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
[00:33.97] My mama couldn't get through to me (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[00:37.06] The drama, people suing me
[00:39.49] I'm on TV talkin' like it's just you and me
[00:42.72] I'm just saying how I feel, man
[00:45.38] I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hell, man (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[00:49.18] I guess the money should have changed him
[00:51.46] I guess I should have forgot where I came from
[01:14.46] 
[00:54.13] La, la, la-la (ayy)
[00:57.03] Wait 'til I get my money right
[00:59.94] La, la, la-la (yeah)

[01:18.96] Let up the suicide doors
[01:21.00] This is my life, homie, you decide yours (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[01:25.07] I know that Jesus died for us
[01:27.68] But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
[01:29.51] So I parallel double park that motherfucker sideways
[01:33.17] Old folks talking 'bout back in my day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[01:37.30] But, homie, this is my day, class started two hours ago
[01:41.05] Oh, am I late? (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[01:58.55] 
[01:42.44] No, I already graduated
[01:44.75] And you can live through anything if Magic made it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[01:48.87] They say I talk with so much emphasis
[01:52.57] Ooh, they so sensitive
[01:54.74] Don't ever fix yo' lips like collagen
[01:57.07] And then say something where you gonna end up apologin' (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[02:01.47] Let me know if it's a problem man
[02:04.48] A'ight man, holla then
[02:15.48]

[02:32.77] Let that man get cash
[02:34.13] Let that man get passed
[02:37.06] He 'on't even stop to get gas
[02:38.67] If he can move through the rumors
[02:40.21] He can drive off of fumes 'cause
[02:42.39] How he move in a room full of no's?
[02:45.23] How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
[02:48.42] Must be the Pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
[02:51.47] So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
[03:11.47] 
[02:55.02] Treasure, what's yo' pleasure?
[02:57.03] Life is a, uh, dependin' how you dress her
[03:00.44] So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam, Eve wear nada

[03:07.19] With way less effort
[03:09.29] 'Cause when you try hard, it's when you die hard
[03:13.19] Y'all homies lookin' like, why God?
